Architecture -

  - Has a secure login authentication as only staff and 
  - it runs on a seperate port and sends api requests to the server by using the server's url
  - react-axios is used instead of fetch to make ajax requests to the server
  - 

Testing - 
 
 - Login verifications has been tested.
 - It pops up alert messages when given wrong login credentials.

Differences between Part A and Part B -

 -Part A does not have a seperate frontend port whereas in Part D , React uses it's own seperate port to run the frontend

 - React handles the routes on its own just requires the backend to fetch data to and from.
   Whereas in Part A all the routes were in the serevr itself.
